## Secret Auction

This program asks user for each bidder's name and their bid individually. 

```
Welcome to the secret auction program. 
What is your name?: Siddhesh
```
```
What's your bid?: $123
```
```
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
yes

```
If there are other bidders, then clear the screen, so user can pass his phone to the next person. If there are no more bidders, then the program will display the name of the winner and their winning bid. 

```
The winner is Elon with a bid of $55000000000
```

Here, I used my knowledge of Python dictionaries and loops to build this project.
